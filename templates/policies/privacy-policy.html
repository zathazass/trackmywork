	<p class="p3"><br></p>
	<h1>When do we use customer information from third parties?</h1>
	<p class="p10"><span class="s1">We receive some information from the third parties when you contact us. For example,
			when you submit your email address to us to show interest in becoming our customer, we receive information
			from a third party that provides automated fraud detection services to us. We also occasionally collect
			information that is made publicly available on social media websites. You can control how much of your
			information social media websites make public by visiting these websites and changing your privacy
			settings.</span></p>
	<p class="p3"><br></p>
	<h1>Do we share the information we collect with third parties?</h1>
	<p class="p10"><span class="s1">We may share the information that we collect, both personal and non-personal, with
			third parties such as advertisers, contest sponsors, promotional and marketing partners, and others who
			provide our content or whose products or services we think may interest you. We may also share it with our
			current and future affiliated companies and business partners, and if we are involved in a merger, asset
			sale or other business reorganization, we may also share or transfer your personal and non-personal
			information to our successors-in-interest.
			<br><br>
			We may engage trusted third party service providers to perform functions and provide services to us, such as
			hosting and maintaining our servers and our service, database storage and management, e-mail management,
			storage marketing, credit card processing, customer service and fulfilling orders for products and services
			you may purchase through our platform. We will likely share your personal information, and possibly some
			non-personal information, with these third parties to enable them to perform these services for us and for
			you.
			<br><br>
			We may share portions of our log file data, including IP addresses, for analytics purposes with third
			parties such as web analytics partners, application developers, and ad networks. If your IP address is
			shared, it may be used to estimate general location and other technographics such as connection speed,
			whether you have visited the service in a shared location, and type of device used to visit the service.
			They may aggregate information about our advertising and what you see on the service and then provide
			auditing, research and reporting for us and our advertisers.
			<br><br>
			We may also disclose personal and non-personal information about you to government or law enforcement
			officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in order to

			actionable activity, or to otherwise comply with applicable court orders, laws, rules and regulations.

			You can cancel your participation in any of these email lists at any time by clicking on the opt-out link or
			other unsubscribe option that is included in the respective email. We only send emails to people who have
			authorized us to contact them, either directly, or through a third party. We do not send unsolicited
			commercial emails, because we hate spam as much as you do. By submitting your email address, you also agree
			to allow us to use your email address for customer audience targeting on sites like Facebook, where we
			display custom advertising to specific people who have opted-in to receive communications from us. Email
			addresses submitted only through the order processing page will be used for the sole purpose of sending you
			information and updates pertaining to your order. If, however, you have provided the same email to us
			through another method, we may use it for any of the purposes stated in this Policy. Note: If at any time

			or personnel, or to third parties, located throughout the world, and may be viewed and hosted anywhere in

	<p class="p3"><br></p>
	<h1>Is the information collected through our service secure?</h1>
	<p class="p10"><span class="s1">We take precautions to protect the security of your information. We have physical,
			electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard, prevent unauthorized access, maintain data
			security, and correctly use your information. However, neither people nor security systems are foolproof,
			including encryption systems. In addition, people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail to
			follow policies. Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot
			guarantee its absolute security. If applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty to protect your
			personal information, you agree that intentional misconduct will be the standards used to measure our
			compliance with that duty.</span></p>
	<p class="p3"><br></p>
	<h1>Can I update or correct my information?</h1>
	<p class="p10"><span class="s1">The rights you have to request updates or corrections to the information we collect
			depend on your relationship with us. Personnel may update or correct their information as detailed in our
			internal company employment policies.
			Customers have the right to request the restriction of certain uses and disclosures of personally
			identifiable information as follows. You can contact us in order to (1) update or correct your personally
			identifiable information, (2) change your preferences with respect to communications and other information

			and deletions will have no effect on other information that we maintain, or information that we have
			provided to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change or
			deletion. To protect your privacy and security, we may take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique
			password) to verify your identity before granting you profile access or making corrections. You are
			responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.
			You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the
			information you have provided to us from our system. The need to back up our systems to protect information
			from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be
			difficult or impossible for us to locate. Promptly after receiving your request, all personal information
			stored in databases we actively use, and other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected, changed
			or
			deleted, as appropriate, as soon as and to the extent reasonably and technically practicable.
			If you are an end user and wish to update, delete, or receive any information we have about you, you may do
			so by contacting the organization of which you are a customer.</span></p>

	<h1>Information about General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h1>
	<p class="p10"><span class="s1">We may be collecting and using information from you if you are from the European
			Economic Area (EEA), and in this section of our Privacy Policy we are going to explain exactly how and why
			is this data collected, and how we maintain this data under protection from being replicated or used in the
			wrong way.</span></p>
	<p class="p12"><br></p>
	<h1>What is GDPR?</h1>
	<p class="p10"><span class="s1">GDPR is an EU-wide privacy and data protection law that regulates how EU residents'
			data is protected by companies and enhances the control the EU residents have, over their personal data.
			<p class="p12"><br></p>
			<h1>What is personal data?</h1>
			<p class="p10"><span class="s1">Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual. GDPR
					covers a broad spectrum of information that could be used on its own, or in combination with other
					pieces of information, to identify a person. Personal data extends beyond a person’s name or email
					address. Some examples include financial information, political opinions, genetic data, biometric
					data, IP addresses, physical address, sexual orientation, and ethnicity.
					The Data Protection Principles include requirements such as:</span></p>
			<ul class="ul1">
				<li class="li11"><span class="s3">Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal, and
						transparent way and should only be used in a way that a person would reasonably expect.</span>
				</li>
				<li class="li11"><span class="s3">Personal data should only be collected to fulfil a specific purpose
						and it should only be used for that purpose. Organizations must specify why they need the
						personal data when they collect it.</span></li>
				<li class="li11"><span class="s3">Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to fulfil its
						purpose.</span></li>
				<li class="li11"><span class="s3">People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own personal
						data.
						They can also request a copy of their data, and that their data be updated, deleted, restricted,
						or moved to another organization.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="p12"><br></p>
			<h1>Why is GDPR important?</h1>
			<p class="p10"><span class="s1">GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should protect
					individuals' personal data that they collect and process. It also raises the stakes for compliance
					by increasing enforcement and imposing greater fines for breach. Beyond these facts it's simply the
					right thing to do. At Help Scout we strongly believe that your data privacy is very important and we
					already have solid security and privacy practices in place that go beyond the requirements of this
					new regulation.</span></p>
			<p class="p12"><br></p>
			<h1>Individual Data Subject's Rights - Data Access, Portability and Deletion</h1>
			<p class="p10"><span class="s1">We are committed to helping our customers meet the data subject rights
					requirements of GDPR. We process or store all personal data in fully vetted, DPA compliant vendors.
					We do store
					all conversation and personal data for up to 6 years unless your account is deleted. In which case,
					we dispose of all data in accordance with our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, but we will not
					hold it longer than 60 days.
					<br><br>
					We are aware that if you are working with EU customers, you need to be able to provide them with the
					ability to access, update, retrieve and remove personal data. We got you! We've been set up as self
					service from the start and have always given you access to your data and your customers data. Our
					customer support team is here for you to answer any questions you might have about working with the
